## 📌 Key Design Decisions (Finalized)

### 1️⃣ PvP Mode Strategy
- **Phase 1 (Launch)**: Asynchronous PvP
  - Battle against opponent's saved deck (AI-controlled)
  - No server infrastructure needed
  - Works offline, thoughtful gameplay
- **Phase 2 (Post-Launch)**: Real-time synchronous PvP
  - WebSocket-based live battles
  - Tournaments, spectator mode
  - Requires backend infrastructure

### 2️⃣ Monetization Model (NO Pay-to-Win)
- **Cosmetic-Only Purchases**:
  - Spell skins (visual effects)
  - Character skins & avatars
  - UI themes (dark, neon, fantasy)
  - Battle arenas, emotes
- **Premium Battle Pass**: Cosmetic rewards + XP boost (NOT exclusive spells)
- **Gem Uses**: Cosmetics, marketplace trades, convenience features
- **Fair F2P**: All spells obtainable through gameplay

### 3️⃣ Spell Trading Marketplace
- **Player-to-Player Trading** (Phase 5)
- **Gem Currency**: Trade spells using premium currency
- **Anti-Abuse**: Level 25+ requirement, daily limits, transaction fees
- **Dynamic Pricing**: Supply/demand market, price history tracking

### 4️⃣ Mobile Platform Strategy
- **Phase 1**: Mobile-first web (PWA)
  - 375px minimum width design
  - Touch-optimized UI (44px+ targets)
  - Offline support, add to home screen
  - Portrait primary, responsive scaling
- **Phase 6**: Native mobile apps
  - React Native/Capacitor
  - iOS & Android stores
  - Cross-platform save sync
  - Native push & IAP

## 🎯 What You Can Do Now

### Option 1: Launch Multiple Claude Agents (Recommended)
Use the Task tool to spawn 6 specialized agents working in parallel:

```
Agent 1: Combat Core - Builds battle engine
Agent 2: Spell Library - Creates 70+ spells
Agent 3: UI/UX - Builds React components
Agent 4: Progression - Implements leveling/gacha
Agent 5: AI & Modes - Creates game modes
Agent 6: State & Integration - Manages global state
```

Each agent has:
- Clear task list (Week 1-2, 3-4, 5-6)
- Defined deliverables
- Integration points
- Example code to start with

### Option 2: Solo Development
Follow the plan sequentially:
1. Phase 1 (Weeks 1-3): Core combat
2. Phase 2 (Weeks 4-6): Progression & collection
3. Phase 3 (Weeks 7-9): Advanced combat
4. Phase 4 (Weeks 10-12): Game modes
5. Phase 5 (Weeks 13-16): Polish & economy
6. Phase 6 (Weeks 17-20): Social & endgame

### Option 3: Team Development
Assign real developers to agent roles, use docs for coordination.

## 💡 Pro Tips

### For Multi-Agent Development
1. **Spawn all 6 agents at once** for maximum parallelism
2. **Agent 1 & 6 are critical** - prioritize them
3. **Agent 2 & 3 can work independently** early on
4. **Weekly integration sprints** - merge all work
5. **Use event bus heavily** - loosely couple systems

### For Balance
1. **Start with DPM ratios** (Damage Per Mana)
2. **Playtest with AI vs AI** (10k+ battles)
3. **Track spell usage rates** - buff unused spells
4. **Nerf top 5%** only if >60% win rate
5. **Update monthly** based on data

### For Performance
1. **Memoize all calculations** (React.memo, useMemo)
2. **Virtual scroll** collections (1000+ items)
3. **Debounce** state updates (animations)
4. **Code split** by route
5. **Lazy load** spell data
