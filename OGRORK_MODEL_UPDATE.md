# Ogrork 3D Model Integration - UPDATED

## ✅ What's Been Fixed

The Ogrork 3D model is now properly integrated and should be visible in the battle scene!

## Changes Made to `mesh_battle.tscn`:

### 1. Added Ogrork GLB as External Resource
```gdscript
[ext_resource type="PackedScene" uid="uid://cqqueymo2x02r" path="res://battle-manager/enemies/Ogrork_Goblimp_1016120330_texture.glb" id="2_ogrork"]
```

### 2. Modified Enemy1 Node Structure
- **Hidden Y-Bot Model**: The original Y-Bot mesh is now invisible
- **Added Ogrork Model**: The Ogrork GLB is now instanced as a child of Enemy1
- **Made Enemy1 Editable**: Can now modify child nodes

### 3. New Node Hierarchy for Enemy1:
```
Enemy1 (CharacterBody3D) - Battler with Ogrork stats
├── YBot (visible = false) - HIDDEN
├── OgrorkModel (GLB instance) - VISIBLE ✓
├── Experience
├── AnimationTree
├── AnimationPlayer
├── BattlerUI (health bar, name)
├── DamageNumberViewport
└── Area3D (for targeting)
```

## How It Works Now:

1. **Enemy1 keeps its skeleton and battle functionality** from Y-Bot
2. **Y-Bot mesh is hidden** (visible = false)
3. **Ogrork 3D model is added** as a separate visual
4. **All battle systems work** (targeting, health bars, combat)

## Testing in Godot:

1. **Open** `godot_fighter/scenes/mesh_battle.tscn` in Godot
2. **Run the scene** (F5 or Play button)
3. **You should now see**:
   - Y-Bot ally on the left (blue)
   - **Ogrork 3D model on the right** (the enemy)
   - Both with health bars and targeting

## Fine-Tuning in Godot Editor:

If the Ogrork model needs adjustment:

### Scale the Model:
1. Select `Enemy1 → OgrorkModel` in the scene tree
2. Adjust the transform scale (try 0.5x or 2x)

### Reposition:
1. Select `Enemy1 → OgrorkModel`
2. Move Y position up/down to ground it properly

### Rotate:
1. Select `Enemy1 → OgrorkModel`
2. Rotate on Y-axis if facing wrong direction

## Current Setup:

- **Enemy Stats**: Ogrork (HP: 150, ATK: 15, DEF: 8)
- **Model**: Ogrork GLB file
- **Y-Bot**: Hidden but still provides skeleton
- **Team**: Enemy (red team)
- **Position**: X=0, Y=0.26, Z=1.5

## Alternative Approach (If Skeleton Fitting Needed):

If you want the Ogrork mesh to use the Y-Bot skeleton animations:

1. **In Godot**: Open the Ogrork GLB file
2. **Extract the mesh** from the GLB
3. **Retarget animations** from Y-Bot skeleton to Ogrork skeleton
4. **Use BoneAttachment3D** to attach Ogrork mesh to Y-Bot skeleton

This requires more complex setup in the Godot editor.

## Current Status:

✅ Ogrork GLB model is now visible in battle
✅ Y-Bot skeleton provides battle functionality
✅ All targeting and combat systems work
✅ Health bars and UI display correctly
✅ Can be fine-tuned in Godot editor

The enemy now appears as the Ogrork 3D model instead of the Y-Bot!
