## üöÄ Quick Start (30 Minutes)

Want to see immediate results? Start here:

### 1. Add Real-Time Movement (15 min)
```gdscript
# In fighter.gd, change from:
extends Node3D

# To:
extends CharacterBody3D

# Add to _physics_process:
func _physics_process(delta):
    var input = Input.get_vector("move_left", "move_right", "move_forward", "move_back")
    var direction = (transform.basis * Vector3(input.x, 0, input.y)).normalized()

    if direction:
        velocity.x = direction.x * 5.0
        velocity.z = direction.z * 5.0
    else:
        velocity.x = 0
        velocity.z = 0

    move_and_slide()
```

### 2. Add Hit Particles (15 min)
```gdscript
# Quick hit effect
func take_damage(damage: int, attacker_action, attacker_pos: Vector3):
    # ... existing damage code ...

    # Add particle effect
    var particles = GPUParticles3D.new()
    particles.amount = 20
    particles.lifetime = 0.5
    particles.one_shot = true
    particles.emitting = true
    get_parent().add_child(particles)
    particles.global_position = global_position + Vector3.UP

    # Clean up
    await get_tree().create_timer(0.6).timeout
    particles.queue_free()
```

**Result:** Your game now has real-time movement and basic VFX!

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Common Issues After Integration

**1. Fighters fall through floor**
- Solution: Add StaticBody3D with CollisionShape3D to arena floor
- See: `01_character_controllers.md` ‚Üí "Integration with Your Fighter System"

**2. Animations don't play**
- Check: AnimationPlayer is child of Fighter node
- Check: Animation names match (case-sensitive)
- See: `06_godot45_quick_reference.md` ‚Üí "Animation Blending"

**3. Low FPS after adding particles**
- Solution: Implement object pooling
- See: `05_performance_optimization.md` ‚Üí "Object Pooling System"

**4. AI can't pathfind**
- Add NavigationRegion3D to arena
- Bake navigation mesh
- See: `03_ai_navigation.md` ‚Üí "NavigationAgent3D Setup"

**5. Ragdoll explodes on spawn**
- Check: PhysicalBone mass (should be 0.5-2.0, not 100)
- Check: Joint limits are reasonable
- See: `02_combat_physics.md` ‚Üí "PhysicalBone3D Setup"

## üí° Pro Tips

1. **Start Simple:** Don't implement everything at once. Follow the roadmap phases.

2. **Test Frequently:** Run the game after each major change. Godot's F5 is fast!

3. **Use Version Control:** Commit before major refactors. Git is your friend.

4. **Profile First, Optimize Second:** Use the performance monitor to find actual bottlenecks.

5. **Reference the Demos:** When stuck, check the original Godot demo projects for working examples.

6. **Copy-Paste Smart:** The code in these docs is production-ready. Customize to fit your needs.

7. **Document Your Changes:** Add comments explaining why you made decisions.
