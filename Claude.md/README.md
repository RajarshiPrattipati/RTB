# Godot 3D Fighting Game Patterns

Comprehensive code patterns and systems cannibalized from [Godot's official 3D demo projects](https://github.com/godotengine/godot-demo-projects/tree/master/3d) and adapted specifically for 3D fighting game development.

## 📖 Quick Navigation

**START HERE:** [00_INDEX.md](./00_INDEX.md) - Complete overview and roadmap

### Core Documentation

1. **[Character Controllers](./01_character_controllers.md)** - Real-time 3D movement, camera controls, input buffering
2. **[Combat Physics](./02_combat_physics.md)** - Ragdoll knockouts, IK attacks, physics knockback
3. **[AI & Navigation](./03_ai_navigation.md)** - Smart enemy AI, pathfinding, difficulty levels
4. **[Visual Effects](./04_visual_effects.md)** - Particles, lighting, camera effects
5. **[Performance Optimization](./05_performance_optimization.md)** - Graphics settings, 60 FPS optimization
6. **[Godot 4.5 Quick Reference](./06_godot45_quick_reference.md)** - Syntax, templates, common patterns

## 🚀 Quick Start

New to these docs? **30-minute quick start:**

1. Open [00_INDEX.md](./00_INDEX.md)
2. Follow the "Quick Start (30 Minutes)" section
3. Add real-time movement to your fighters
4. Add basic hit particles
5. See immediate results!

## 🎯 What's Inside

All patterns extracted from these Godot demos:
- `kinematic_character` - Movement controllers
- `platformer` - 3D character control
- `ragdoll_physics` - Knockout physics
- `ik` - Inverse kinematics for dynamic attacks
- `navigation` - AI pathfinding
- `particles` - Combat VFX
- `lights_and_shadows` - Arena lighting
- `graphics_settings` - Performance optimization

## 💎 Key Features

- ✅ **Production-ready code** - Copy-paste and customize
- ✅ **Godot 4.5 compatible** - Latest syntax and APIs
- ✅ **Fighting game focused** - Adapted specifically for combat games
- ✅ **Performance optimized** - 60 FPS target for all patterns
- ✅ **Well documented** - Explanations, use cases, integration guides
