# Godot Fighter - React Integration Summary

## What Was Done

Successfully integrated a 3D Godot fighter game into your React application. When users click **"Start Game"**, they now play a fully-featured 3D fighting game instead of the original battle system.

---

## Quick Start

```bash
# 1. Build the Godot game for web
npm run build:godot

# 2. Start React app
npm start

# 3. Click "Start Game" button
# Game launches in fullscreen!
```

### Build System
```
build_godot_game.sh            # Helper script (root)
godot_fighter/export_web.sh    # Export script
package.json                   # Added "build:godot" script

## Modified Files

### `src/components/App/App.js`
- Added `import { GodotGame } from '../GodotGame'`
- Changed `handleStartBattle()` to set mode to `'godot'`
- Added `mode === 'godot'` rendering section
- Hide navigation/UI during Godot mode

---

## How It Works

### Flow
1. User clicks **"Start Game"** in StartMenu
2. App sets mode to `'godot'`
3. GodotGame component loads:
   - Dynamically injects `/public/godot/index.js`
   - Initializes Godot Engine
   - Renders game canvas (1280x720)
   - Shows loading progress
4. User plays 3D fighter
5. "Exit Game" button returns to menu

### Architecture
```
React App
├── StartMenu (Start Game button)
│   ↓
├── App (mode: 'godot')
│   ↓
└── GodotGame Component
    ├── Load Godot Engine
    ├── Initialize Canvas
    ├── Show Progress Bar
    └── Render Game

Game Files (public/godot/)

└── index.pck         (Assets)

## Usage

### Development
```bash
# Edit Godot game
1. Open godot_fighter/project.godot in Godot Editor
2. Modify scripts/scenes
3. Test with F5
4. Rebuild: npm run build:godot
5. Refresh React app

# Edit React integration
1. Edit src/components/GodotGame/GodotGame.js
2. Auto hot-reload (no rebuild needed)
```

### Production
```bash
# Build everything
npm run build:godot    # Build Godot
npm run build          # Build React

# Deploy
# Upload build/ folder (includes public/godot/)
```

## Troubleshooting

| Issue | Solution |
|-------|----------|
| "Failed to load game" | Run `npm run build:godot` |
| Black screen | Check browser console, verify files in `/public/godot/` |
| Godot not found | Install Godot 4.2+, add to PATH |
| CORS errors | Files must be in `/public/` not `/src/` |

## Next Steps (Ideas)

- [ ] Save fight results (wins/losses)
- [ ] Award souls/items for victories
- [ ] Multiple fighter characters
- [ ] Integrate with hero system
- [ ] Two-player mode
- [ ] Tournament mode
- [ ] More stages/arenas
- [ ] Character customization

## Status

✅ **Complete and functional**

The integration is fully working. Users can:
1. Click "Start Game"
2. Play 3D fighter
3. Exit back to menu

The original battle system (`mode: 'battle'`) remains available if needed.

## Requirements

- **Godot 4.2+** to build the game
- **Modern browser** to play (Chrome, Firefox, Edge)
- **~30MB** bandwidth for initial load
