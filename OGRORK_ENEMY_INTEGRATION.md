## Integration into Battle System

The Ogrork enemy has been configured to work with the existing battle system:

### Battle Manager Compatibility
- ✅ Automatically added to "enemies" group
- ✅ Compatible with BattleManager.gd turn system
- ✅ Works with AI Manager for enemy actions
- ✅ Supports skill system and damage calculation
- ✅ Includes health/SP bars and UI elements
- ✅ Mouse interaction for targeting

### Current Integration
The enemy stats have been updated in `mesh_battle.tscn`:
- Enemy1 now uses Ogrork stats (name, health, attack, etc.)
- Ready to be replaced with the full Ogrork scene

## How to Use the Ogrork Enemy in Godot

### Option 1: Replace Existing Enemy (Recommended)
1. Open `godot_fighter/scenes/mesh_battle.tscn` in Godot
2. Delete the `Enemy1` node
3. Add a new instance: Scene → Instance Child Scene
4. Select `godot_fighter/battle-manager/enemies/ogrork_enemy.tscn`
5. Position at transform: `Transform3D(-1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, -1, 0, 0.260986, 1.5)`
6. The enemy will automatically join the battle system

### Option 2: Add Additional Enemy
1. Open any battle scene in Godot
2. Instance the Ogrork enemy scene
3. Position it in the battle arena
4. Ensure it's a child of the root scene (for proper group assignment)
5. The BattleManager will automatically detect it

### Option 3: Create Custom Enemy Variant
1. Duplicate `ogrork_enemy.tscn`
2. Modify stats by creating a new BattlerStats resource
3. Adjust AI intelligence and type as needed
4. Instance in your battle scene

## Animation Setup Notes

The Ogrork enemy scene is set up with:
- **AnimationTree**: Ready for state machine animations
- **AnimationPlayer**: Connected to the model's animations
- **Default Animations**:
  - `battle_idle` - Idle animation
  - `attack` - Attack animation (triggers damage)

### To Add Animations in Godot:
1. Open the Ogrork enemy scene
2. Select the AnimationPlayer node
3. Import/create animations from the GLB file
4. Set up the AnimationTree state machine with:
   - `battle_idle` state
   - `attack` state
   - Other combat animations as needed

## Battle System Features

### Targeting System
- ✅ Mouse hover highlighting (white outline)
- ✅ Selection highlighting (cyan outline)
- ✅ Keyboard navigation support
- ✅ Valid target detection

### Combat Features
- ✅ Turn-based combat integration
- ✅ Skill system compatible
- ✅ Damage calculation (Formulas.gd)
- ✅ State/buff system ready
- ✅ Experience and leveling (defeats award XP)
- ✅ AI-controlled actions

### UI Elements
- ✅ Floating health bar above enemy
- ✅ Character name display
- ✅ Damage number popups
- ✅ Progress bars for health

## Customization

### Adjusting Stats
Edit `godot_fighter/database/battlers/ogrork_stats.tres` or create a new stats resource:
```gdscript
character_name = "Ogrork Boss"
max_health = 300
attack = 25
# etc.
```

### Changing AI Behavior
In the enemy scene properties:
- **Intelligence** (0-100): How smart the AI is
  - 0 = Random actions
  - 100 = Optimal strategy
- **AI Type**:
  - AGGRESSIVE: Focuses on damage
  - DEFENSIVE: Focuses on survival

### Visual Customization
1. Modify `ogrork_material.tres` to change colors
2. Edit the model scale in the scene (currently 1.5x)
3. Adjust collision shape for hitbox size

## Testing the Integration

1. Open Godot and load the project
2. Run `godot_fighter/scenes/mesh_battle.tscn`
3. The battle should start with:
   - Ally (Y-Bot) on the left
   - Enemy (Ogrork stats) on the right
4. Test targeting by clicking on the enemy
5. Test combat by using skills/attacks

## Next Steps

1. **In Godot Editor**:
   - Replace Enemy1 with the actual Ogrork scene instance
   - Set up animations from the GLB file
   - Fine-tune model scale and positioning
   - Test all animations and combat

2. **Optional Enhancements**:
   - Add unique skills for Ogrork
   - Create material variants for different Ogrork types
   - Set up animation retargeting if using Mixamo animations
   - Add particle effects for attacks

## Troubleshooting

### Model Not Showing
- Ensure the GLB file imported correctly (check .import file)
- Verify the model scale (currently 1.5x)
- Check if the model path is correct in the scene

### Enemy Not Appearing in Battle
- Verify the enemy is added to the "enemies" group
- Check team is set to ENEMY (team = 1)
- Ensure BattleManager can find the enemy node

### Animations Not Working
- Open the scene in Godot
- Check AnimationPlayer has animations from the GLB
- Verify AnimationTree state machine is configured
- Ensure animation names match battler.gd expectations

### Targeting Issues
- Verify Area3D collision shape matches enemy size
- Check mouse signals are connected (_mouse_enter, _mouse_exit)
- Ensure is_valid_target is being set by BattleManager
