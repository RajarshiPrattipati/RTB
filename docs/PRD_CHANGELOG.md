## Version 1.2 (2025-10-11)

### üî• MAJOR CHANGE: Combat System Clarification

**Critical Update:** The game is **NOT turn-based**. It's a **real-time simultaneous action system** with 2-second intervals.

#### What Changed

**Previous Understanding (INCORRECT):**
- Turn-based combat (players alternate)
- Each player takes a full turn
- 30-second turn timer

**Current Reality (CORRECT):**
- **Real-time simultaneous action combat**
- **Actions resolve every 2 seconds**
- **Both players act at the same time**
- **Default action: "Charge" (+20 Mana)**

#### How It Works

```
Every 2-Second Interval:
1. Player selects spell OR does nothing
2. If nothing selected ‚Üí Auto-Charge (+20 Mana)
3. Both players' actions resolve simultaneously
4. Animations play, effects apply
5. Next 2-second interval begins
6. Repeat until battle ends (3-minute max)
```

#### Key Implications

1. **Fast-Paced Gameplay**
   - Battles last 1-3 minutes (90 intervals max)
   - Constant decision-making every 2 seconds
   - No waiting for opponent's turn

2. **Resource Management**
   - Charge action = bank Mana
   - Spell cast = spend Mana, build Momentum
   - Strategic: When to bank vs. when to attack

3. **Simultaneous Resolution**
   - Both players can hit each other (double KO possible)
   - Priority system for animation order (instant ‚Üí standard ‚Üí charged)
   - Mind games: Predict opponent's action

4. **No "Turns"**
   - All references changed from "turns" to "intervals"
   - Duration measured in 2-second intervals (not turns)
   - Combo meter builds on spells, decays on Charge

#### Updated Sections

‚úÖ **Section 1.1**: Renamed "Turn-Based" ‚Üí "Real-Time Simultaneous Action"
- Battle flow completely rewritten
- 2-second interval mechanics explained
- Charge action as default

‚úÖ **Section 1.2**: Resource System
- Mana gain: +20 per Charge action (not per turn)
- Energy: +10/interval (not per turn)
- Charge mechanic core resource generation

‚úÖ **Section 2.1**: Spell Timing
- `castTime`: Intervals to charge (0 = instant, 1 = 2s, 2 = 4s)
- `cooldown`: Intervals before reuse (3 = 6 seconds)
- All durations in 2-second intervals

‚úÖ **Section 3.2**: Status Effects
- Duration tracking: Ticks down every 2-second interval
- Example: Burn (3 intervals) = 6 seconds total

‚úÖ **Section 3.3**: Combo System
- +15% per spell cast (NOT Charge)
- -10% decay per interval if Charge used
- Banking vs. Aggression strategic choice

‚úÖ **Section 3.4**: Renamed "Counter System" ‚Üí "Simultaneous Resolution & Priority"
- Priority within interval (instant ‚Üí standard ‚Üí charged)
- Both actions execute (simultaneous damage)
- Counter spells negate specific action types

‚úÖ **Section 7.2**: Battle Screen UI
- 2-second interval timer (circular countdown)
- Charge button (large, bottom-center)
- "Auto-Charge in X.Xs..." indicator
- Queued action display
- Interval tick audio cue at 1s

‚úÖ **Product Vision & Title**
- Changed from "Turn-Based" to "Real-Time Simultaneous Action"
- Core value prop updated

#### Impact on Development

| Area | Impact | Action Required |
|------|--------|-----------------|
| **Battle Engine** | Critical | Rewrite from turn-based to interval-based |
| **UI/UX** | High | Add 2s timer, Charge button, action queue |
| **Spell Design** | Medium | Adjust timings to 2s intervals |
| **AI Opponent** | Medium | Decision-making every 2s (not per turn) |
| **Animations** | Low | Speed options (doesn't affect interval timing) |

#### Reference Games (Updated)

This combat style is similar to:
- **Clash Royale**: Real-time action with card deployment
- **Hearthstone Battlegrounds**: Simultaneous combat rounds
- **Auto Chess/TFT**: Timed preparation ‚Üí simultaneous battle
- **Fighting Games**: Frame-based timing, simultaneous hits

## Version 1.1 (2025-10-11)

### üéØ Key Design Decisions Finalized

#### 1. PvP Strategy ‚úÖ
**Decision:** Support both asynchronous and synchronous PvP, phased approach

**Phase 1 (Launch):**
- Asynchronous PvP: Players battle against opponent's saved deck (AI-controlled)
- Benefits: No server infrastructure needed, works offline, thoughtful gameplay
- Implementation: LocalStorage-based deck sharing

**Phase 2 (Post-Launch):**
- Real-time synchronous PvP with WebSockets
- Live matchmaking, tournaments, spectator mode
- Requires backend infrastructure

**Rationale:**
- Start simple, validate gameplay first
- Async PvP proven successful (Clash Royale, Hearthstone Arena)
- Real-time adds complexity but higher engagement

---

#### 2. Monetization Model ‚úÖ
**Decision:** Strictly cosmetic-only, NO pay-to-win

**Core Principles:**
- ‚úÖ Premium currency (Gems) CANNOT buy gameplay advantages
- ‚úÖ All spells obtainable through free gameplay
- ‚úÖ Cosmetic-only purchases (skins, animations, themes, emotes)
- ‚úÖ Premium battle pass: Cosmetic rewards + XP boost (NOT exclusive spells)

**What Can Be Purchased:**
- **Spell Skins**: Custom visual effects for existing spells
- **Character Skins**: Player avatar customization
- **UI Themes**: Dark mode, neon theme, fantasy theme, etc.
- **Battle Arenas**: Visual backgrounds for battles
- **Emotes & Victory Poses**: Social expression
- **Premium Battle Pass**: Cosmetic track with exclusive skins

**What CANNOT Be Purchased:**
- ‚ùå Exclusive powerful spells
- ‚ùå Stat boosts or power increases
- ‚ùå Extra deck slots (beyond free limit)
- ‚ùå Guaranteed spell drops (pity system is free)

**Gem Uses (Premium Currency):**
- Cosmetic purchases
- Spell marketplace trading fees
- Premium battle pass
- Convenience features (deck slot expansion, skip animations)

**Rationale:**
- Fair play = better retention
- Cosmetics generate revenue without affecting balance
- Proven model: League of Legends, Fortnite, Path of Exile

---

#### 3. Spell Trading Marketplace ‚úÖ
**Decision:** YES - Player-to-player trading using Gems (Post-launch)

**Implementation (Phase 5):**
- Players can list spells for sale
- Buyers pay in Gems (premium currency)
- 10% transaction fee (Gem sink, prevents inflation)
- Search, filter, and watchlist functionality
- Price history tracking (30-day graphs)

**Trading Rules:**
- **Level Requirement**: Player must be level 25+ (anti-bot measure)
- **Active Deck Restriction**: Cannot trade spells in active deck
- **Listing Duration**: 7 days auto-expire
- **Price Limits**: Min 10 Gems, Max 10,000 Gems per spell
- **Daily Trade Limit**: 5 trades per player (anti-inflation)

**Economic Safeguards:**
- Dynamic pricing based on supply/demand
- System buyback option (convert to Shards if no buyer)
- Seasonal events affect market (themed spell drops)
- Market monitoring for manipulation

**Rationale:**
- Gives value to duplicate spells
- Creates Gem demand (monetization)
- Player-driven economy increases engagement
- Safeguards prevent abuse

---

#### 4. Mobile Platform Strategy ‚úÖ
**Decision:** Mobile-first web design, native port planned

**Phase 1 (Launch): Mobile-First Web**
- Design for 375px minimum width (iPhone SE)
- Touch-optimized UI (44px+ tap targets)
- Portrait orientation primary
- Responsive breakpoints: Mobile (375px+), Tablet (768px+), Desktop (1024px+)
- Progressive Web App (PWA) features:
  - Offline support (cached battles)
  - Add to home screen
  - Web push notifications
  - Background sync

**Phase 6 (Post-Launch): Native Mobile**
- React Native or Capacitor wrapper
- iOS App Store & Google Play release
- Native features:
  - Push notifications
  - In-app purchases (cosmetics)
  - Deep linking
  - Cross-platform save sync

**Mobile-First Design Principles:**
- **Progressive Disclosure**: Essential info first, details on tap
- **Gesture Navigation**: Swipes, long-presses, pull-to-refresh
- **Thumb-Zone Optimization**: Primary actions in lower 2/3 of screen
- **Performance**: Battery saver mode, data saver mode
- **Loading**: Skeleton screens, progressive image loading

**Rationale:**
- Mobile gaming is 50%+ of market
- PWA allows app-like experience without stores
- Native port maximizes reach later
- Mobile-first ensures desktop works well too
